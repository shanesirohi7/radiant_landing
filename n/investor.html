        <h2>Our Vision: Replacing Instagram & Facebook</h2>
        <p>Social media today is broken. Fake engagement, doom scrolling, intrusive ads, and an algorithm that profits off addiction.</p>
        <p><strong>Radiant is different.</strong> We are the first genuine social network designed for real connections without the manipulation.</p>
        <p>We‚Äôre not just building another app. We‚Äôre <strong>rewriting how social networking works.</strong> No distractions. No wasted time. No doom scrolling. Just pure networking, real engagement, and an unstoppable movement.</p>
